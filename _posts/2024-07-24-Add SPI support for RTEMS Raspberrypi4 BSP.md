# Add SPI support for RTEMS Raspberrypi4 BSP

Mainly refer to `dev/bsps/shared/dev/spi/cadence-spi.c`

RTEMS uses a linux-based framework. The SPI Bus has been implemented in the RTEMS kernel. In this project, I need to implement the SPI master controller driver of RPi 4 and SSD1306 driver. The implementation of SPI in RTEMS as shown in the block diagram:
![SPI-RTEMS](https://github.com/yangn0/yangn0.github.io/blob/main/picture/SPI-RTEMS.png?raw=true)

First, register the SPI host controller device on the bus. The register function is as follows:
```c
rtems_status_code raspberrypi_spi_init(raspberrypi_spi_device device)
{
  raspberrypi_spi_bus *bus;
  int eno;
  volatile raspberrypi_spi *regs;
  const char *bus_path;

  bus = (raspberrypi_spi_bus *) spi_bus_alloc_and_init(sizeof(*bus));
  if (bus == NULL) {
    return RTEMS_UNSATISFIED;
  }

  switch (device) {
    case raspberrypi_SPI0:
      regs = (volatile raspberrypi_spi *) BCM2711_SPI0_BASE;
      bus_path = "/dev/spidev0";
      break;
    case raspberrypi_SPI3:
      regs = (volatile raspberrypi_spi *) BCM2711_SPI3_BASE;
      bus_path = "/dev/spidev3";
      break;
    case raspberrypi_SPI4:
      regs = (volatile raspberrypi_spi *) BCM2711_SPI4_BASE;
      bus_path = "/dev/spidev4";
      break;
    case raspberrypi_SPI5:
      regs = (volatile raspberrypi_spi *) BCM2711_SPI5_BASE;
      bus_path = "/dev/spidev5";
      break;
    case raspberrypi_SPI6:
      regs = (volatile raspberrypi_spi *) BCM2711_SPI6_BASE;
      bus_path = "/dev/spidev6";
      break;
    default:
      spi_bus_destroy_and_free(&bus->base);
      return RTEMS_INVALID_NUMBER;
      break;
  }

  eno = spi_bus_register(&bus->base, bus_path);
  if (eno != 0) {
    spi_bus_destroy_and_free(&bus->base);
    return RTEMS_UNSATISFIED;
  }

  eno = raspberrypi_spi_init_gpio(device);
  if (eno != 0) {
    spi_bus_destroy_and_free(&bus->base);
    return RTEMS_INVALID_NUMBER;
  }

  bus->regs = regs;
  bus->num_cs = 2;

  bus->base.transfer = raspberrypi_spi_transfer;
  bus->base.destroy = raspberrypi_spi_destroy;
  bus->base.setup = raspberrypi_spi_setup;
  bus->base.bits_per_word = 8;
  bus->base.max_speed_hz = 250000000;
  bus->base.cs = 0;
#ifdef BSP_SPI_USE_INTERRUPTS
  bus->irq = BCM2711_IRQ_SPI;

  eno = rtems_interrupt_handler_install(
    bus->irq,
    "SPI",
    RTEMS_INTERRUPT_SHARED,
    raspberrypi_spi_interrupt,
    bus
  );
  if (eno != RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL) {
    return EAGAIN;
  }
#endif

  return RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL;
}
```
Call `spi_bus_alloc_and_init`, which is a function implemented by the SPI bus driver and is located in the RTEMS kernel `dev/cpukit/dev/spi/spi-bus.c`.
```
Allocates a bus control from the heap and initializes it. After a sucessful allocation and initialization the bus control must be destroyed via spi_bus_destroy_and_free(). A registered bus control will be automatically destroyed in case the device file is unlinked. Make sure to call spi_bus_destroy_and_free() in a custom destruction handler.

parameter
size â€“ The size of the bus control. This enables the addition of bus controller specific data to the base bus control. The bus control is zero initialized.

return
non-NULL The new bus control.
NULL An error occurred. The errno is set to indicate the error.
```

In the `switch` structure, select the `SPI register address` and the `path name` according to the value of the enum `raspberrypi_spi_device`. Register addresses are defined in the `raspberrypi.h` file.

Set various parameters and interface functions of the bus.
Use the macro definition `BSP_SPI_USE_INTERRUPTS` to select the driver to use interrupt mode or polling mode.

The installation of interrupt handlers, taking into account the situation of enabling multiple SPIs at the same time, use `RTEMS_INTERRUPT_SHARED`.
```c
  eno = rtems_interrupt_handler_install(
    bus->irq,
    "SPI",
    RTEMS_INTERRUPT_SHARED,
    raspberrypi_spi_interrupt,
    bus
  );
```

Call `spi_bus_register` to register the device into the bus. This function is implemented in the SPI bus driver.

Call `raspberrypi_spi_init_gpio` to initialize gpio and set gpio to the correct function. The reason for placing this function after `spi_bus_register`: to avoid restoring gpio when `spi_bus_register` fails.

Next, I introduce the transfer function, which is used to handle SPI reading and writing.
```c
static int raspberrypi_spi_transfer(
  spi_bus *base,
  const spi_ioc_transfer *msgs,
  uint32_t msg_count
)
{
  int rv = 0;
  raspberrypi_spi_bus *bus;
  bus = (raspberrypi_spi_bus *) base;

  rv = raspberrypi_spi_check_msg(bus, msgs, msg_count);
  if (rv == 0) {
    bus->msg_todo = msg_count;
    bus->msg = msgs;
#ifdef BSP_SPI_USE_INTERRUPTS
    bus->task_id = rtems_task_self();
    
    raspberrypi_spi_start(bus);
    rtems_event_transient_receive(RTEMS_WAIT, RTEMS_NO_TIMEOUT);
#else
    raspberrypi_spi_transfer_msg(bus);
#endif
  }

  return rv;
}
```
Call the `raspberrypi_spi_check_msg` function to check msg. It mainly checks whether a mode not supported by the driver is used and whether cs exceeds the total number of cs.
msg_count needs to be passed in here, because msgs is a queue with consecutive addresses and may contain multiple msg.

If the check passes, the `part variables` of the data information structure are assigned to the corresponding variables in the bus structure.

If you use interrupt mode, enter `raspberrypi_spi_start`, and use polling mode, enter `raspberrypi_spi_transfer_msg`.

This article mainly introduces the interrupt mode.

`raspberrypi_spi_start` only needs to start the transmission. For the RPI4 SPI controller, setting TA=1 will trigger the first interrupt immediately. I think this is the biggest difference from other BSPs.
```c
static void raspberrypi_spi_start(raspberrypi_spi_bus *bus)
{
  volatile raspberrypi_spi *regs;
  regs = bus->regs;
  
  regs->spics = regs->spics | RPI_SPICS_INTR | RPI_SPICS_INTD;
  /* 
   * Set TA = 1. This will immediately trigger a first interrupt with 
   * DONE = 1. 
   */
  regs->spics = regs->spics | RPI_SPICS_TA;
}
```

The interrupt handling function is as follows:
```c
static void raspberrypi_spi_interrupt(void *arg)
{
  raspberrypi_spi_bus *bus;
  volatile raspberrypi_spi *regs;
  uint32_t val;
  
  bus = arg;
  regs = bus->regs;

  if (raspberrypi_spi_irq(regs)) {
    
    if (bus->todo > 0) {
      raspberrypi_spi_push(bus, regs);
    } else {
      --bus->msg_todo;
      ++bus->msg;
      raspberrypi_spi_next_msg(bus);
    }

    while (regs->spics & RPI_SPICS_RXD && bus->in_transfer > 0) {
      /*  RX FIFO contains at least 1 byte. */
      val = regs->spififo;
      if (bus->rx_buf != NULL) {
          *bus->rx_buf = (uint8_t)val;
          ++bus->rx_buf;
      }
      --bus->in_transfer;
    }
        
  }
}
```
The function `raspberrypi_spi_irq` is used to determine whether the interrupt is generated by the current SPI device. This allows multiple SPI devices to be used simultaneously.

The function `raspberrypi_spi_next_msg` is used to switch to the next msg and assign the remaining variables in the msg structure to the bus structure.

`rtems_event_transient_receive` and `rtems_event_transient_send` are crucial

`rtems_event_transient_receive` is called when the transfer starts.
```c
	bus->task_id = rtems_task_self();
	rtems_event_transient_receive(RTEMS_WAIT, RTEMS_NO_TIMEOUT);
```
`rtems_event_transient_send` is called at the end of the transfer.
```c
	rtems_event_transient_send(bus->task_id);
```
It guarantees that a transfer command blocks until the end of the transfer.
